This project is to give people a sample of my work. I have no problem with anyone using my code in their wn bots, however, please make your ownbot and enter it's token at the bottom instead of using the one in here.

There are a variety of text emoji based functions of this bot to make them easier to access, including ಠ_ಠ, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, (/) (°,,°) (/), and {(>_<)}.

The most complicated functions of this bot would be waifu and gim. Both of them take in arguments and search either danbooru.donmai.us/ or images.google.com to search for the user's desired images. I learned basic web scraping and how to read specific parts of HTML tags to write these. I used BeautifulSoup4.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at arogers7@buffalo.edu. I'm sure my friends are sick of me talking their ears off about my side projects, so I'd be happy to answer any questiosn!
