## General information about these projects

I've uploaded two of my personal projects so far, my auto-emailer and discord bot, to demonstrate my proficiency at creating programs from scratch, as well as teaching myself new packages and information in order to successfully accomplish my goals. For more detailed explanations, please check out the individual README.md files in each folder.

#### Discord Bot
This is a chat bot for discord.

#### Auto-emailer
This was intended to be used to automate the emailing of student matches in UBA's mentorship program. 

#### Dungeons and Dragons Dice Simulators
This is a desktop app that can be used instead of physical dice for DND. There are button for 20, 6 and 4 sided dice, as well as a manual text input for any rolls for a custom number of sides.

#### Exercises
This is for coding challenges or problems that I want to model.

## Contact Info
If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me at arogers7@buffalo.edu. I'm sure my friends are sick of me talking their ears off about my side projects, so I'd be happy to answer any questions!
