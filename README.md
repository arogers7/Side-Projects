## General information about these projects

I've uploaded two of my personal projects so far, my auto-emailer and discord bot, to demonstrate my proficiency at creating programs from scratch, as well as teaching myself new packages and information in order to successfully accomplish my goals. For more detailed explanations, please check out the individual README.md files in each folder

#### Discord Bot
This is a chat bot for discord.

#### Auto-emailer
This was intended to be used to automate the emailing of student matches in UBA's mentorship program. 

#### Goats and Cars
This is a model of the Monty Hall problem.

## Contact Info
If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me at arogers7@buffalo.edu. I'm sure my friends are sick of me talking their ears off about my side projects, so I'd be happy to answer any questions!
