## General information about these projects

I've uploaded two of my personal projects so far, my auto-emailer and discord bot, to demonstrate my proficiency at creating programs from scratch, as well as teaching myself new packages and information in order to successfully accomplish my goals.

#### Discord Bot
To run this bot, change to the "Discord" directory then run lonelybot.py

There are a variety of text emoji based functions of this bot to make them easier to access, including ಠ_ಠ, ¯\\\_(ツ)__/¯, (/) (°,,°) (/), and {(>____<)}.

The most complicated functions of this bot would be waifu and gim. Both of them take in arguments and search either danbooru.donmai.us or images.google.com to search for the user's desired images. I learned basic web scraping and how to read specific parts of HTML tags to write these.

Additionally, I wrote a feedback function which formats the arguments given when it is called as a string, then sends an email to my personal account.

For a full updated list of commands, call "^commands" while the bot is running.

#### Auto-emailer
This was intended to be used to automate the emailing of student matches in UBA's mentorship program. Students information was collected with a google forms survey, which output them as a .xlsx file. Using excel's sort function, students are seperated by year (freshmen as mentees and juniors, seniors, and sophomores as mentors) then matched based on major and career goals. Saved as a .csv file, it's added an argument to the program. The auto-emailer then sends personalized emails to all participants, giving them the name, major, career goals, and contact info of their match.
