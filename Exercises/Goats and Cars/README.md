This is a simulation of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhlc7peGlGg">Monty Hall Problem</a>, which is a problem in statistics where the intuitive answer is in fact incorrect. I "proved" the Monty Hall Problem by writing a program that runs a version of the game where the user chooses to switch their door and another where the user chooses to remain with their original answer. I run both 10,000 times, and count the number of times that each results in a win. In the end, you can see that the games where the contestant switches their response wins twice as many games as the contestant who chose to remain with their original answer.
