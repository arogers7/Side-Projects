##Problem022: Electoral College

The 50 states plus D.C. have electoral votes as follows: 55, 38, 29, 29, 20, 20, 18, 16, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3. How many ways can a candidate get exactly 270 votes? (Assume each stateâ€™s votes go to a single candidate, ignoring the congressional district method of allocating votes used by Maine and Nebraska.)

##Problem023: 4 million divisors
The number 12 has 6 divisors (1,2,3,4,6,12) and has strictly more divisors than all numbers smaller than it. Likewise, 5040 has 60 divisors, again strictly more than all numbers less than it. What number less than 10^27 has more than four million divisors and also has strictly more divisors than all numbers less than it?

Answer requirement: Please use a comma after every third digit from right to left.
