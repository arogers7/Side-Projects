## What is does
This application is designed to replace the need for physical dice while playing Dungeons and Dragons.

## How is works
There is a home screen with three buttons: D20, D6 and D4. These are the most commonly used dice in DND. To roll, the user must simply click on the button that corresponds to the number of sides that their intended die has. If you need to roll a less common die, there is a text input option, where users can type in the number of sides of their intended die.

The next menu has a button that has the results of your roll, as well as a fact from the star wars universe.

## Star Wars Facts
The star wars facts are drawn for the Star Wars API (SWAPI). Facts are drawn from a random species or planet, and tidbits like most commonly spoken language, population, etc are presented along with the results of the roll.

## What is the coming next for this application?
I want to make it more accessible for non-tech people. I also intend to make it "prettier", as it is fairly bare bones right now.
