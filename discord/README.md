There are a variety of text emoji based functions of this bot to make them easier to access, including ಠ_ಠ, ¯\\\_(ツ)__/¯, (/) (°,,°) (/), and {(>____<)}.

The most complicated functions of this bot would be waifu and gim. Both of them take in arguments and search either danbooru.donmai.us or images.google.com to search for the user's desired images. I learned basic web scraping and how to read specific parts of HTML tags to write these.

Additionally, I wrote a feedback function which formats the arguments given when it is called as a string, then sends an email to my personal account.

For a full updated list of commands, call "^commands" while the bot is running.
