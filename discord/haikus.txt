Opening their hearts
ice and water become
friends again

The spring sun
shows its power
between snowfalls

Not in a hurry
to blossom—
plum tree at my gate

White plum blossoms
return to the withered tree—
moonlit night

The warbler
wipes its muddy feet
on plum blossoms

With each falling petal
they grow older—
plum branches

Dried grasses—
and just a few heat waves
rising an inch or two

Overflowing with love
the cat as coquettish
as a courtesan

Both partners
sport whiskers—
cats’ love

Spring sun
in every pool of water—
lingering

Is the dawn, too,
still embraced by
hazy moon?

In the shimmering haze
the cat mumbles something
in its sleep

Spring rain—
just enough to wet tiny shells
on the tiny beach

The nurseryman
left behind
a butterfly

Again and again
stitching the rows of barley—
a butterfly

A pheasant’s tail
very gently brushes
the violets

Over the violets
a small breeze
passes by

Each time the wind blows
the butterfly sits anew
on the willow

Spring chill—
above the rice paddies
rootless clouds

Daybreak—
the whitefish whiten
only one inch

Domestic ducks
stretch their necks
hoping to see the world

The warbler
dropped his hat—
a camellia

Crazed by flowers
surprised by the moon—
a butterfly

White camellias—
only the sound of their falling
moonlit night

Squeaking in response
to baby sparrows—
a nest of mice

Out from the darkness
back into the darkness—
affairs of the cat

Joyful at night
tranquil during the day—
spring rain

A camellia falls
spilling out
yesterday’s rain

A hedge of thorns—
how skillfully the dog
wriggled under it!

Misty day—
they might be gossiping
horses in the field

An old well—
falling into its darkness
a camellia

Trampling on clouds,
inhaling the mist,
the skylark soars

Crouching,
studying the clouds—
a frog

On the temple bell
perching and sleeping—
a butterfly

Could they be sutras?
in the temple well
frogs chant

Recited on and on,
the poems of the frogs
have too many syllables

Bracing his feet
and offering up a song—
the frog

From the nostril
of the Great Buddha comes
a swallow

On the brushwood gate
in place of a lock—
one snail

Sunlight
passes through a butterfly
asleep

With the power of non-attachment
floating on the water—
a frog

Highlighting the blossoms,
clouded by blossoms—
the moon

Flower petals
set the mountain in motion—
cherry blossoms

On the surface
of petal-covered water—
frogs’ eyes

The retreating shapes
of the passing spring—
wisteria

Spring passes—
the last reluctant
cherry blossoms

Shallow river
twisting west and twisting east—
young leaves

Forsythia—
and radiant spring’s
melancholy

In daytime “darken the day”
at night “brighten the night”
frogs chant

Crossing the sea
into a net of mist—
the setting sun

Misty grasses—
water without voices
in the dusk

Spring passing—
looking at the sea,
a baby crow

The cuckoo
with a single song
has established summer

The voice of the cuckoo
slants
over the water

The cuckoo calls—
and the waters of the lake
cloud over a little

The cuckoo—
flies and insects,
listen well!

Summer rains—
leaves of the plum
the color of cold wind

Early summer rains—
lunging at the blue sea
muddy waters

Early summer rains—
even nameless rivers
are fearsome

Summer cool—
in the green rice fields
a single pine

Only Fuji
remains unburied—
young leaves

On the hydrangeas
the weight of the morning sun,
the evening sun

Mountain ant—
seen so clearly
on the white peony

Alone, silently—
the bamboo shoot
becomes a bamboo

The warbler
amid the bamboo shoots
sings of old age

A triangle—
is the lizard’s head getting
a little longer?

In my dwelling
friendly with the mice—
fireflies

How interesting—
running errands right and left
fireflies

Pursued,
it hides in the moon—
the firefly

Burning so easily,
extinguishing so easily—
the firefly

The morning breeze
ripples the fur
of the caterpillar

As the lake breeze
cools his bottom
the cicada cries

As lightning flashes
he strokes his head—
the toad

The snake flees—
but the eyes that peered at me
remain in the weeds

Rustling, rustling,
the lotus leaves sway—
a tortoise in the pond

Today too
mosquito larvae—
and tomorrow again

As flies retreat
mosquitoes start
their battle cry

Dashing into one another
whispering, parting—
ants

Inhaling clouds
exhaling clouds—
mountaintop pines

Across a pillar of mosquitoes
hangs the bridge
of dreams

Even the clams
keep their mouths shut
in this heat

Motionless
in a crevice of an old wall—
a pregnant spider

Heat in waves—
in the stones
angry reverberations

Sudden shower—
and rising from the heat,
the broken-down horse

Lightning!
fleeing up the wall,
the legs of a spider

Sudden shower—
clutching the blades of grass
a flock of sparrows

Down a paulownia tree
the rain comes trickling
across a cicada’s belly

The tree frog
riding the plantain leaf
sways

“It’s much too long a day,”
opening its mouth
a crow

The fish
not knowing they’re in a bucket
cool by the gate

A sudden shower
drums down upon
the heads of the carp

Lightning—
yesterday to the east
today to the west

Even in a single blade of grass
the cool breeze
finds a home

The trout leaps up—
and below him in a stream
clouds float by

How quiet—
at the bottom of the lake
peaks of clouds

At the sound of the sea
the sunflowers open
their black eyes

Octopus pot—
evanescent dreams
of the summer moon

Short summer night—
flowing through reeds
bubbles from crabs

Stillness—
seeping into the rocks
the cicada’s voice

How beautifully
the cow has slimmed down
in the summer fields

In the morning dew
soiled and cooled—
dirt on the melon

Summer coolness—
lantern out,
the sound of water

Summer rains—
secretly one evening
moon in the pines

The bat’s
secret home—
a tattered hat

Evening glories—
the cat chewing the flower
has its mind elsewhere

Among the ears of barley
are you hiding your tail?
old fox

The coming of autumn
determined
by a red dragonfly

The stars
have already opened
their autumn eyes

Early autumn—
the evening shower becomes
a night of rain

Autumn begins—
ocean and fields
all one green

Early autumn—
peering through willows
the morning sun

Morning glories—
blown to the ground
bloom as they are

As dew drips
gently, gently, the dove
murmurs its chant

Grasses and trees all
waiting for the moon—
dewy evening

White dew
on brambles and thorns—
one drop each

On blades of grass
frolic and roll on—
pearls of dew

Dew cooling—
things with shapes
all alive

Its face
looks like a horse—
the grasshopper

Dragonfly on a rock
absorbed in
a daydream

The dragonfly
cannot come to rest
on the blades of grass

Kittens
playing hide-and-seek
in the bush clover

Dragonflies
quiet their mad darting—
crescent moon

The bat
circling the moon
would not leave it

Give me back my dream!
a crow has wakened me
to misty moonlight

Dyeing his body
autumn—
the dragonfly

Distant mountains
reflecting in its eyes—
a dragonfly

A floating sandal—
an object of scorn
to the plovers

The pine wind
circling around the eaves—
autumn deepens

Cool breeze
filling the empty sky—
pine voices

To the mountain quietude
the quiet
rain

The old dog
is leading the way—
visiting family graves

Typhoons ended,
the rat swims across
flowing waters

Calling three times,
then no more to be heard—
the deer in the rain

Running across the shelf
hoisting a chrysanthemum—
a temple mouse

On a withered branch
lingers the evanescent memory
of a cicada’s voice

Singing as it goes,
an insect floats down the stream
on a broken bough

“The eyes of the hawks
are now dimmed,”
quails sing

A grasshopper
chirps in the sleeve
of the scarecrow

The fields have withered—
no need for the crane
to stretch out its neck

The first goose
seeking its own sky
in the dusk

When they fall,
just as they fall—
garden grasses

Mountains darken—
robbing the scarlet
from maple leaves

The moon speeds on—
the treetops
still holding rain

A rock
against the moon
sits big

The bright moon—
out from the sleeve
of the scarecrow

Fallen leaves
fall on each other—
rain beats on the rain

Blown from the west
collecting in the east—
falling leaves

The old pond’s
frog also growing old—
fallen leaves

Sweeping
and then not sweeping
the fallen leaves

Very squarely
setting its buttocks down—
the pumpkin

The autumn wind
takes the shape
of pampas grass

To passing autumn
the pampas grass waves
goodbye goodbye

Autumn rains—
a spider encased in
a clump of fallen grass

Evening fog—
my horse has learned
the holes on the bridge

The sound
of the raindrops
also grown older

In the harvest moonlight
standing nonchalantly—
the scarecrow

Its hat fallen off
and embarrassed—
the scarecrow

A rinse of vermilion poured
from the setting sun, and then
autumn dusk

The bitter persimmons
spending their autumn
quietly

Garden gate
slamming and thwacking—
autumn wind

Just like people
the monkey clasps its hands—
autumn wind

One edge
hanging over the mountain—
the Milky Way

The moon in the water
turns somersaults
and flows away

Whiter than
the stones of Stone Mountain—
the autumn wind

The autumn wind
at the sliding door—
a piercing voice

The huge setting sun—
little remains of
its power

All in calmness—
the earth with half-opened eyes
moves into winter

New garden
stones settling down—
first winter rain

Red berries—
just one has fallen
frosty garden

Without a companion,
abandoned in the fields
winter moon

Camphor-tree roots
silently soak in
the early winter rain

How amusing,
it may change into snow—
the winter rain

Crescent moon warped
coldness
keen and clear

First snow—
just enough to bend
the narcissus leaves

On the mandarin duck’s wings
a dust of snow—
such stillness!

Cold moon—
the gateless temple’s
endless sky

Unable to wrap it
and dropping the moon—
the winter rain

How warm—
the shadows of withered trees
stretching out their arms

There’s nothing
he doesn’t know—
the cat on the stove

On a mandarin duck
its beauty is exhausted—
winter grove

The sea grows dark
the voice of the duck
faintly whitens

Cold moon—
among the withered trees
three stalks of bamboo

Its saddle taken off
how cold it looks—
the horse’s rump

Snow
falls on snow—
and remains silent

Wolves
are keening in harmony—
snowy evening

If it had no voice
the heron might disappear—
this morning’s snow

Dawn—
the storm is buried
in snow

Withered by winter
one-colored world—
the sound of wind

The winter moon
trailing its white glow
leaves the mountain

The salted sea bream’s
teeth are also chilly—
fish-market shelf

Bleakly, bleakly
the sun enters into the rocks—
a withered field

Blistering wind—
splintered by rocks
the voice of the water

Today is also ending—
at the bottom of the snowstorm
a gigantic sun

Wintry blasts—
blown off into the ocean
the evening sun

Sad stories
whispered to the jellyfish
by the sea slug

Frozen together,
what are they dreaming?
sea slugs

In the eyes of the hawk
over the withered fields
sits the winter storm

Coming to the sea
the winter wind has no place
to return

In the abandoned boat
dashing and sliding—
hail

Flowing down
ice crushes
ice

The winter storm
hides in the bamboo
and becomes silent

Dearly, dearly
embracing the sun—
the fallen garden leaves

Each plum blossom
brings a single blossom’s
warmth

The warbler
sings upside-down
his first note

The tiny child—
shown even a flower
opens its mouth

Flea bites—
while counting them, she nurses
her baby

Shielding an infant
from the wind—
a scarecrow

Garden butterfly—
as the baby crawls, it flies
crawls—flies—

A child on my back
I picked a bracken shoot
and let him hold it

Her mother eats
the bitter parts—
mountain persimmons

The harvest moon—
“Get it for me!”
cries the child

“It’s this big!”
forming a peony with her arms—
a child

Today too!
today too! kites caught
by the nettle tree

Spring rains—
a child teaches the cat
a dance

Worse than tears—
the smile of the
abandoned child

The season’s first melon
clutched in its arms
sleeps the child

Blazing sun—
whose barefoot child
is running free?

At the ticket window
our child becomes
one year younger

The youngest child
visiting family graves
carries the broom

First love—
coming close to a lantern
face-to-face

Secret night rendezvous—
a mosquito was swatted
and died quietly

Heaven knows,
earth knows, every neighbor knows—
parents don’t know

Sharing one umbrella—
the person more in love
gets wet

Catching up
and looking at her—
nothing special

Hearing footsteps
splitting in two
the shadow

Waving umbrellas
“goodbye” . . . “goodbye” . . .
gossamer haze

Having children,
you understand—
but too late

Pear blossoms—
a woman reads a letter
by moonlight

Harvesting radishes,
he points the way
with a radish

Workers—
they laugh
in a single color

Selling ladles,
he shows how to scoop up
nothing at all

Chanting the Lotus Sutra—
only his lips
are busy

With both hands
thrust up mightily—
my yawn

Trout fishing—
more fishermen
than trout

Very secretly
the medicine peddler
is sick

The convalescent—
indulging in his mother’s care
has become a habit

Losing,
he straightens in his seat
and loses again

Having given my opinion
I return home to
my wife’s opinion

Priding himself
on scolding
his beautiful wife

“Every woman . . .”
he starts to say,
then looks around

“After you die
they’ll be valuable”
he tells the painter

Skeletons
covered with adornment—
flower viewing

Wanting to be logical
he tries so hard—
the drunkard

“Let’s pull them all”
says the dentist
generously

“I’d never lose
in a sumo match”—
pillow talk

No talents
also no sins—
winter seclusion

Winter seclusion—
from my wife and children
I too play hide-and-seek

New Year’s cards
with women’s handwriting
get looked at first

She lowers
her eloquent lap
onto his silent lap

The kimono for flower-viewing—
disrobing, I’m entwined in
a myriad of sashes

Without a word
the guest, the host,
white chrysanthemums

Out from the gate,
I too become a traveler—
autumn dusk

Walking along the river
with no bridge to cross—
the day is long

Cold moon—
feeling the pebbles
under my shoes

A single guest
visits a single host—
autumn evening

“Coming, coming,”
but someone still knocks—
snowy gate

My go rival—
how vexing
and how dear

Getting old—
I slip on a watermelon rind
as I dance

My nose running
I play a solitary go-game—
night chill

Just asking them to fight,
he saved tons of money
and died

—HAKUCHŌ
Flesh getting thin—
these are thick bones

Feeling my bones
on the quilting—
frosty night

Charcoal fire—
my years dwindle down
just like that

For me leaving
for you staying
two autumns

Owning nothing—
such peace,
such coolness!

Left to live on
left to live on and on—
this cold

Loneliness
also has its pleasure—
autumn dusk

Autumn of my years—
the moon is perfect
and yet—

Walking the dog
you meet
lots of dogs

Taking a nap
I hide within myself—
winter seclusion

All of a sudden
my first fallen tooth—
autumn wind

—SANPŪ
Winter rain—
I’m not dead yet

A whole family
all gray-haired with canes
visits graves

This autumn
no child in my lap—
moon-viewing

Are my youthful dreams
still unfinished?
this morning’s frost

The auspiciousness
is just about medium—
my spring

On New Year’s Day
the morning in town
comes irregularly

First winter kimono—
may you quickly grow to
a naughty age

Snow has melted—
the village is full
of children

“Don’t dare break it!”
but he broke off and gave me
a branch of garden plum

Spring river—
a tiny wooden clog
floats by

Spring rain—
blown onto the bush
a discarded letter

A shame to pick it
a shame to leave it—
the violet

Even when chased
it pretends not to hurry—
the butterfly

One sneeze—
and I lost sight of
the skylark

Tired heart—
mountains and ocean
too much beauty

Lead him slowly!
the horse is carrying
the spring moon

Come out!
you can almost touch
the spring moon

Spring moon—
if I touch it, it would
drip

Spring rain—
I gave my yawn
to the dog at the gate

While I ponder
a snail
passes me by

Frogs grow silent—
noble humans
are passing by

Early summer rain—
a letter from home
arrives wet

Sudden shower—
riding naked
on a naked horse

Rocks and trees
glisten in my eyes—
such heat

The stone-carver
cools his chisel
in the clear stream

A hoe standing
with no one around—
the heat!

Becoming a cow
would be fine—morning naps
and the evening cool

After my sneeze
all is quiet—
summer mountains

Only the moon and I
remain on the bridge
cooling off

One person
and one fly
in the large room

The fly on the porch
while rubbing its hands—
swat!

Each time
I swat a fly, I chant
“Namu Amida Butsu”

Mosquito larvae,
dancing a Buddhist chant
in the water by the grave

Being hit
the gong spits out
a noontime mosquito

Sharing the same blood
but we’re not related—
the hateful mosquito!

The flute player
bitten by a mosquito
on the edge of his lips

Swarms of mosquitoes—
but without them,
it’s a little lonely

During the day
the Buddha shelters behind
mosquitoes

The beggar
wears heaven and earth
as summer clothes

Where there are people
there are flies, and
there are Buddhas

They live long—
the flies, fleas, and mosquitoes
in this poor village

Two old bent backs
sitting close, wrapped in
a shower of cicada songs

In my hand
its fleeting light vanishes—
the firefly

How delightful
walking on dewy grasses—
straw sandals

Killing the spider
then so lonesome—
evening cold

Seeing that I’m old
even the mosquito whispers
closer to my ear

An autumn mosquito
determined to die
bites me

Before the white mums
hesitating for a while—
the scissors

Truly the autumn has come—
I was convinced
by my sneeze

Planting my buttocks
on a huge taro leaf—
moon-viewing

Whatever they wear
they become beautiful
moon-viewing

Taking me along
my shadow comes home
from moon-viewing

Even grandma
goes out drinking—
moonlit night

Wild geese muttering, muttering—
are they spreading
rumors about me?

Don’t cry, wild geese,
it’s the same everywhere—
this floating world

A man raking—
the leaves keep
calling him back

Dusk—
while the earth and I talk
leaves fall

When I show my delight
they fall down faster—
acorns

Coldly, coldly
the sun slips into my sleeve—
autumn mountains

Autumn wind—
in my heart, how many
mountains and rivers

Deep in the mountains—
falling into my heart
autumn streams

More than last year
it is lonely—
the autumn dusk

On my shoulder
is it longing for a companion?
a red dragonfly

Love in my old age—
as I try to forget,
late autumn rain

When I finally die—
weeds
falling rain

From the nose
of the Buddha in the fields—
icicles

Visitors
kindly create a path
through the snow at my gate

The black dog
becomes a lantern—
snowy road

Winter sun—
frozen on horseback
is my shadow

Piercing cold—
I dropped my broom
under the pines

Colder than snow
on my white hair—
the winter moon

A hundred miles of frost—
in a boat, I own
the moon

Peaceful, peaceful
chilly, chilly
snow, snow

To my cat
a New Year’s card
from its vet

The child on my lap
begins to point at
plum blossoms

Plum blossoms—
“Steal this one here!”
points the moon

Under the trees
into the salad, into the soup—
cherry blossoms
